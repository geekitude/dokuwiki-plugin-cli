ORIGINAL README
This plugin brings a Command Line Interface formatter to Dokuwiki allowing you to format the output of a transcript say for a user manual or on-line tutorial. It is designed to work with the output of a standard Unix Bash Shell, but should be suitable to document other kinds of CLI interaction, e.g. Windows Command Window, Python and Ruby, Matlab, etc.

I made this plugin for personal use and haven't needed to change it. If you want to add functionallity, please fork it!

WHAT I DID
Removed unwanted files, added plugin.info.txt to avoid an error on install (plugin installing to plugins/plugin-cli instead of plugins/cli) and personalized style to my taste.
Finally added some basic support for some wiki syntax in shell output (bold; italic; underline; monospaced; wrap em, hi and lo), one per output line.
